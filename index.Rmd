I am an Environmental Studies Major with Statistics and Political Science Minors at Bucknell University in the class of 2024. Raised in Allentown, PA, I'm an avid Philadelphia sports fan, and I love spending my free time playing/watching sports, enjoying nature, and playing the piano. Through my classes I have picked up data visualization skills that can be observed through this website; I encourage you to look through them at your leisure!
